# Lightspeed eCom E-Series (Ecwid) Bug Bounty

At Lightspeed, we have a public bug bounty program where we collaborate with security researchers and reward them for reporting issues that have actual security impact to us.

If you have found a vulnerability, [submit it here](https://bugcrowd.com/engagements/lightspeed-retail).

Our program provides guidance on which targets are in scope and how findings correspond to different payouts. Please make sure to review the Testing Guidance and References section specifically for Lightspeed eCom (E-Series) in scope targets before testing!

We look forward to seeing your reports.

Happy hacking!
